Hello! Thank you for choosing my evolving bows to help with your project!  
All I ask is for some credit if you publish your game!

I wanted to make a small  note, the black images were placeholders in my art program and I did not delete them.
There is also an image to guide you on which bows and arrows match together and at what stages.  

If you have any questions or concerns please post them on the itch page or email me at MUCommissions@gmail.com
I do not check these daily, but I will get back to you as soon as I see your message!
